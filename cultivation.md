A vital element of the economic production of Algae Biofuels is growing the algae efficiently. Botryococcus is often described as relatively difficult to grow; however, this should be viewed as a relative comparison to other algae rather than an absolute statement. It is certainly not as difficult as many tissue culture systems and the like, but it is easy to neglect its needs because it is such a slow grower (and then it equally slow to recover). There is also very limited well-documented efforts where one has gone beyond simple 'maintenance' of cultures. We hope to provide within these documents a description that will convey experience to allow someone to rapidly get to 'happy cultures' and try to minimize the 'art' as opposed to rationale considerations that are based on expereince.

We have grown Botryococcus on very high light (~1000 uE/m2/s), low light, very high density, 5% CO2 and even air. All are possible, though remember that adaptation for a slow growing organism requires many months.
